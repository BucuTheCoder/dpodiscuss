      <h3 class="discussion-title">About The Project</h3>
      <p class="discussion-content">
        The project, titled "Web Services for Data Protection Office," is an internship initiative focused on replacing
         the current use of Google Forms with a more robust web application for managing sensitive data. 
         This new web app is designed to streamline the submission of incident reports, requests for data disposal, document reviews, 
         and requests for student personal data. By transitioning from Google Forms to a dedicated web application, 
         the project aims to enhance the efficiency, security, and user experience of data management within the institution. 
         It reduces the manual workload on staff, ensuring that data protection protocols are consistently followed. 
         The web app provides a user-friendly interface that simplifies interaction for both staff and students while ensuring compliance with data protection regulations. 
         Additionally, the project safeguards sensitive information, aligning with current data protection standards. 
         Ultimately, this initiative is a significant step toward modernizing and securing the institutionâ€™s data management practices.
      </p>

      <h3 class="discussion-title">My Role</h3>
      <p class="discussion-content">
        In this project, I served as a full stack developer, responsible for both the backend and frontend development. 
        I utilized PHP to build the backend infrastructure, ensuring the web services are robust, secure, and efficient. 
        On the frontend, I employed the Bootstrap framework to create a responsive and user-friendly interface. 
        My work involved integrating these components to provide a seamless experience for users submitting incident reports, data disposal requests, document reviews, 
        and student personal data requests. This comprehensive approach allowed me to contribute to the overall functionality and design of the web application, 
        ensuring it meets the needs of the Data Protection Office.
